# antenna-analyzer
This a a fork/clone of the famous K6BEZ antenna analyzer.

I have build the hardware and still testing the software.

## Arduino
Directory DDS_sweeper contains code from K6BEZ

Directory DDS_sweeper2 is DK2JK version that works with the PC software VNA (vna.exe)

## PC Software

The PC Software (https://github.com/billygr/antenna-analyzer/tree/master/VNA_program_source) is from DG7EAO.
I did a cleanup from the original source, make sure that it compiles clean using Visual Studio Community 2015.
